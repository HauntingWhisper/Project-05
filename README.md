# Project 5
## Implementation / Features you added
You play as a rat in a large dungeon filled with three rooms two smallish ones and one large one. the large room filled with thrown furniture and trinkets and put into a maze with two ways to get through.
You collect cheese as you pass thorugh the maze trying to reach the big cheese.
you are able to play as first-person player-controlled mouse that can move with keyboard and mouse controls
A maze to navigate though 
cheese to collect 
materials on everything, used at least 7 different materials
at least 11 different light sorces used in creative ways like making it orangeish yellow to put in a furnace and make it look like a fire glow, a similar way to the torches and other light fixtures. 
You start off with a main menu to play the game and if you collete the big cheese it ends
the sloe object of the game is to get to the big cheese at the end of the level.
I have music playing in the background for atmoshpere, a warm crackling fire.
I believe I have creative use of lights for things like me making it orangeish yellow to put in a furnace and make it look like a fire glow, and doing something similar to the torches and other light fixtures. 
I also believe I have creative use of materials such as rat texutre for the enemies, wool for book and ice for the light fixtures and metal
I also made things look as nice as possible visually 
I also thought it was clever (but also painful) to make the player a rat trying to beat other rats in collecting cheese after we made the cheese materials
oh yeah plus the use of different models, those being the rats~ 
I made this so much harder on myself tho T-T
